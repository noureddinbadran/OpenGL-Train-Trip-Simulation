# OpenGL-Train-Trip-Simulation
Train trip simulation is a graphics project for Damascus University faculty of Information Technology Engineering.

## About the project
We have applied a lot of graphics effects like:
- Blending for a train' windows
- Lighting and Shadowing
- Sound Effect
- 3Ds Models using Blender
- Transparency effect with blending for TGA photos
- Two type of camer, either camera Free or moving camera depending on Train' movement.

## Tools
We have used C++ graphics library(OpenGL)

## Dependencies
You need to have on your local machine the following things:

- **Visual Studio 2012 or 2013(Recommended)** to build & run the project.

- **OpenGL files** to run the project successfully
I have attached all needed files within the project under the "Dependencies\OpenGL_FIles" directory, so let's put it in the right place:
1st: Take all files with extension ".lib" and put them into the following directory:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\lib
2nd: Take all files with extension ".h" and put them into the following directory:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include
3nd: Take all files with extension ".dll" and put them into the following directory:
    C:\Windows\System (in case if your OS is 64bit)
    C:\Windows\System32 (in case if your OS is 32bit)
  
## To run the project
  1st: Go to directory "Ghraphces  project" and extract "Data.rar"
  2nd: Open your VS and do clean & rebuild then run the project
